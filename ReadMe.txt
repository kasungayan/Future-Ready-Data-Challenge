Folder Structure
================

(*) Scripts folder: Contains all the source files, including the intermediate files generated through scripts().
	This also includes the train-dataset.csv, train dataset IM challenge.csv, and test.scv files that are neeed by the initial scripts.

		Execusion order:
		
			1) feature_augmentation.R: Creating new feature (combined) using existing timestamp feature.
			
				Input file: train-dataset.csv
				Output file:train-features.csv
			
			2) feature_instace_complete.R: generate the incomplete records of each customer.
			
				Input file: train-features.csv
				Output file: forecast-complete.csv
				
			3) feature_normalize.R: feature normalization and factorization.
			
				Input file: forecast-complete.csv
				Output file: forecast-impute.csv
				
			4) lasso_impute.R: imputing incomplete (N/A) values of Energy consumption using lasso regression.
			
				Input file: forecast-impute.csv
				Output file: imputed_timeseries.csv
				
			5) test-dataset.R: Prepares the raw test.csv for the forecasting (Facilitate to match with the appropriate forecast in the forecasting scripts)
			
				Input file: test.csv
				Output file: test-forecast.csv
				
				
			6) forecast-energy-consumption-ets.R: Forecasting using ETS() function from forecast() package.
			
				Input file: imputed_timeseries.csv, test-forecast.csv
				Output file: Energy-forecast-ets.csv
				
			7) forecast-energy-consumption-arima.R: Forecasting using Auto.ARIMA() function from forecast() package.
			
				Input file: imputed_timeseries.csv, test-forecast.csv
				Output file: Energy-forecast-autoarima.csv
				
			8) forecast-energy-consumption-es.R: Forecasting using ES() function from Smooth() package.
			
				Input file: imputed_timeseries.csv, test-forecast.csv
				Output file: Energy-forecast-es.csv
				
				
			9) ensemble.R: Combining the forecasts using weighting (ensembling)
			
				Input file: Energy-forecast-ets.csv, Energy-forecast-autoarima.csv, Energy-forecast-es.csv
				Output file: Kasun-Submission.csv
				
(*) Files folder: Contains all the source files, including the intermediate files generated through scripts.

			1) train dataset IM challenge.csv : Original training datafile given in the competetion.

			2) train-dataset.csv : The ordered dataset based on customer (Done using simple Excel filtering)
				
				Note: This file replaces the missing values values of Zip codes by "0" (so we can consider as another category as there are customer IDs with 0 zip codes)
				Also removes the record of 1143, as the energy consumption is zero (doesn't add anything for learning), also this customer isn't in the test set.
				
			3) train-features.csv: Contains the new feature (combined) using existing timestamp feature.
			
			4) forecast-complete.csv: Contains complete records of each customer (2015-November to 2018-January)
			
			5) forecast-impute.csv: Normalised records for imputation.
			
			6) imputed_timeseries.csv: Imputed energy consumption values using lasso regression.
			
			7) test.csv: Original test datafile given in the competetion.
			
			8) test-forecast.csv: Prepared test file for forecasting.
			
			9) Energy-forecast-ets.csv: Forecasts of ETS.
			
			10) Energy-forecast-autoarima.csv: Forecasts of ARIMA.
			
			11) Energy-forecast-es.csv: Forecasts of ES.
			
			12) Kasun-Submission.csv : Final submitted file.
				
				
(*) Plots folder: Contains all the forecasting plots generated by forecasts.


		1) ETS_Forecasts.pdf : Forecasting plot for each customer of test set using ETS()
		
		2) ARIMA_Forecasts.pdf : Forecasting plot for each customer of test set using ARIMA()
		
		3) ES_Forecasts.pdf : Forecasting plot for each customer of test set using ES()

(*) All: Contains all the files (Files in Scripts folder + Files folder+ Plots folder)
